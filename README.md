# Islanders - Abandoned Project
###### Description copied from the CozyCloud museum.

Islanders was a custom game intended to replace Skyblock. It was a game in which players would start on a lush island in water and make use of its resources and unlock new islands to their territory. Eventually dangerous islands with pvp enabled could be accessed with the possibility of getting valuable resources. A large marketplace, quests, and cutscenes were planned. We worked on this from May 2022 until July 2022 although much of it was preliminary code that didn't do much on its own without the rest of the game completed. Here is a video of the unfinished spawn, built by Insequent1443, that was intended for newcomers to learn the basics and start their island:
